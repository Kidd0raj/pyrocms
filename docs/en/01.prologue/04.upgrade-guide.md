Before continuing please refer to the [release notes](../prologue/release-notes) to see more information on what has been changed.

### Updating Dependencies

The following dependencies should be removed from your `composer.json` file.

- `wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin`
- `anomaly/streams-composer-plugin`

### Remove Core References

Core addons are now loaded as "native" addons via the addition of the native addon path loader. Core addons will continue to be supported, but collide with Composer 2 and the future of PyroCMS. Addons go in the vendor directory. See below for project/one-off addons.

### Bump Version

Lastly, update the version in `resources/streams/config/distribution.php`.
